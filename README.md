# PokéNext

Gotta catch'em all!

PokéNext is an UI Demo of a pokedex done in React and Next.js. It uses data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) project, with UI created by me, to display comprehensive data from the first 1025 Pokémon. The project was done using React and Next.js (and Typescript) for a study case of these frameworks.

It connects to it's own API to save local settings and has an auth integration with github. It can operate also in a guest mode without auth being necessary.

## Getting Started

Run this to start dev server at localhost:3000.

```bash
npm run dev
```

I am also working currently in a fully dockerized Back End service for the PokeAPI along with this Front End project.

Here are some screenshots of the project:
